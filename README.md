# Performance_Analysis_SCS
This is a part of an ongoing masters thesis at IIT ISM DHANBAD (CSE Department). The end goal is to find an optimized algorithm to do performability analysis in Safety 
Critical Systems using fog networking and Deep reinforcement learning. The algorithm uses greedy epsilon techniques along with multi-armed bandit to find best and 
reliable fog nodes for successful completion of tasks or subtasks which constitute for a larger operation.
